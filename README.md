# Creating a Namespace and Bucket on EMC ECS using Python


This Python code creates a namespace and bucket on an EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) system. The namespace is created with a specified name and the default data services virtual pool, policy group, and retention period. The bucket is then created with a specified name and storage quota, and versioning and retention rules can be enabled. The bucket also has a default lifecycle rule to delete objects after one year.
